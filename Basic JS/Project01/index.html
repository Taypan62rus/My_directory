    <h1>About sitting lifestyle</h1>
    <p>
        I don't like to sit in front of the computer all day.<br>
        But like many other people I don't have a choice<br>
        because if you want to do your work fast you should use a computer.<br>
        There is no other way.<br>
        In the past people didn't spend so much time sitting.<br>
        And I think that this lifestyle we have today<br>
        might be dangerous for our health<br>
        because our bodies are made for active lifestyle.<br>
        People who don't move enough ruin their health.<br>
        I don't want to have health problems<br>
        So I often go out and exercise.<br>
        Scientists say that it can help you to feel better<br>
        and be productive at work.<br>
        But I do it because it has a lot of health benefits.
