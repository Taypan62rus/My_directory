            <h2>Who should we listen</h2>
            <p>
                Should you listen to others or listen to yourself?
                I think that there is so much information in our lives today.
                In the past people asked others for their opinion or advice.
                But today we have many opinions because of the Internet
                that is really hard to make the rigt choice.
                I think the best strategy here is to listen to yourself and use your own experience.
